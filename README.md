# ModalJazz
A SuperCollider tool for providing a 'reasonable MIDI hand-drawn facsimile' of an improvising modal jazz trio (think Miles Davis' 'So What'), based on an input of a sequence of pitch classes and diatonic modes.  

The bass logic, created by Yasuhiro Sekine, is pretty solid.  The drum logic provided by myself (not a drummer, let alone a jazz drummer) is heavily inspired by reading analyses of the great Elvin Jones, while interesting, isn't remotely convincing.

The piano is minimal, intended merely to help guide other improvisers through the chord progression.
